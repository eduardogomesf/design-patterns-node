# **Design Patterns**

A design pattern is a typical solution to problems that commonly occur in object-oriented design.

Different from libraries, you can't not just copy and paste it into your code.
First, you willl need to understand what problem the specific pattern is trying to solve, and then you will be able to implement it, most of the times with some kind of customization to suit your needs.

## Algorithms vs Design Patterns
Sometimes these concepts may be confused, but they are different. Algorithms define a clear set of actions that can be applied to achieve some goal, while Design Patterns
is a high-level description of a solution.

## History of Design Patterns
In 1994, Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson, and Richard Helm, aka the gang of four, published a book called "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" where they applied the concept of design patterns to programming. The book featured 23 patterns solving various problems of object-oriented design.
The book is well known as "the book by the gang of four".

Since then, many design patterns were discovered, some of them are not applied when using object-oriented design, but, other programming fields.

## Why to learn:
- Design patterns are a toolkit of tried and test solutions to common problems
- Most of them are not language-specific, which means they are known concepts by developers from different fields

## Classification of patterns
The most basic and low-level patterns are often called idioms. They usually apply only to a single programming language.

The most universal and high-level patterns are architectural patterns. Developers can implement these patterns in virtually any language. Unlike other patterns, they can be used to design the architecture of an entire application.

Below we can see the three main groups of Design Patterns:
- [Creational Patterns](./creational/creational-patterns.md)
- [Structural patterns](./structural//structural-patterns.md)
- Behavioral patterns
