# **Observer Pattern**

**Observer** is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify
multiple objects, aka subscribers, about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

This pattern is also known as Event-Subscriber or Listener

## Roles
Publisher -> Emits events of interest to subscribers (other objects) <br/>
Subscriber -> Interface that will be implemented by the concrete subscribers (real objects) <br/>
Concrete Subscribers -> Real objects that are observing the publisher in order to perform some action after being notified <br/>
