# **Adapter Pattern**

**Adapter** is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate

It does exactly what an adapter does in real life.

It's often use to set boundaries to the layers of an application, like the core modules be decoupled from third-party dependencies.

## Roles
Client Interface -> Interface that the client code depends on <br/>
Adaptee -> Third-party dependency or legacy code that will be adapted <br/>
Adapter -> Implementation that adapts the Adaptee to suit the Client Interface
