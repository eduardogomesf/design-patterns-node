# **Composite Pattern**

**Composite** is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

## Roles
Component -> Interface that describes operations that are common to both simple and complex elements of the tree
Leaf -> Element of the tree that does not have any child(sub-elements)
Composite -> Also called as container, is an element that has sub-elements: leaves or other containers.
