# **Decorator Pattern**

**Decorator** is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

Decorators allow us to extend functionalities without the need to create subclasses

## Roles
Component -> Interface of the object that will be decorated <br/>
Concrete Component -> Real object that will be decorated <br/>
Base Decorator -> Interface of the decorator <br/>
Concrete Decorator -> Real implementation of the decorator <br/>
